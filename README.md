# chip8cl - Hackable CHIP-8 Emulator in Common Lisp

THIS IS A WORK IN PROJECT, I am not 100% done.

The CHIP-8 is a popular virtual machine originally developed by Joseph
Weisbecker in the mid 70's. It's been ported to early
microcontrollers, C64, and even in a Super Famicom cartriage.

## Why would you write another CHIP-8 emulator?

While CHIP-8 emulators are not that hard to write, I think it's a good
project to learn a programming language. It's a single project that is
challenging enough that it can propel you to
high-beginner/low-intermediate level in language in one step.

- Upcomming blog post about OCaml vs Common Lisp vs C vs Zig
- I wanted to re-learn CL (and OCaml)
- I wanted to explore Zig
- I already understand how to implement a CHIP-8 because I did it in C
  years ago
- ???
- PROFIT

### Key Mapping

- TODO


### Status / TODOs

- Upcomming blog post on experience (Lispers will enjoy it ^^)
- Input
- Sound
- A few minor opcodes not working, mostly due to conflicting
  documentation and me being lazy
